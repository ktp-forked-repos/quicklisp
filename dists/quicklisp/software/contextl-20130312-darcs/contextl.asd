Configuration flags (can be added to *features* before compiling ContextL):

:cx-disable-dynamic-environments disables dynamic-wind / proceed functionality
(and avoids the incurred overhead)

:cx-fast-special-symbol-progv avoids the added check for special symbols
(not necessary for correct semantics, only for added safety during development)

:cx-disable-special-class-in-layered-classes removes the metaclass special-class
from the metaclass layered-class and especially avoids the overhead when
initializing instances of such classes

:cx-disable-layer-gc disables the garbage collector for layers
(only interesting if you redefine layers and related generic functions at runtime,
 should not have a serious effect on runtime performance)
