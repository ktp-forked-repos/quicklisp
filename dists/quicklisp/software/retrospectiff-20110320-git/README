Retrospectiff is a common lisp library for reading, and, hopefully,
one day, writing images in the TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)
format.

The git repository can be found at:

http://git.cyrusharmon.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=retrospectiff.git

There is currently no documentation, no website and no examples. But,
to get started, check out the read-tiff-file function.

(defparameter *snow-image* (read-tiff-file "images/snow.tiff"))

Currently, only a small subset of TIFF images are supported, but it
can read 8-bit RGB and ARGB images in both uncompressed form and LZW
compressed form.

Planned features include:

 * Reading grayscale images
 * Reading 4- and 16-bit-per-sample images
 * Writing more formats of TIFF images
 * Performance enhancements
