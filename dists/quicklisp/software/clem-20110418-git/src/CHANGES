1. Removed aref-vals field

2. Removing matrix-class field from matrix subtypes

3. Added a new allocate-matrix-vals generic and changed matrix
   shared-initialize to call this function. This protocol should
   ensure that the matrix storage only gets allocated once. We still
   need to make sure the typed matrices deal with this change
   properly. row-vector and col-vector have been changed.

4. removed simple-matrix and unsigned-byte-matrix.cl
