    <h1> Cyrus Harmon's Lisp Matrix Package </h1>
    
    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    
    <p>
      I'm sure this has been a written a thousand times before, but,
      partially because I need such a thing and partially as an
      exercise in both LISP programming and matrix operations, I have
      written a common-lisp package for matrix operations
    </p>

    <p>
      The package consists of common-lisp classes, methods and
      functions for creating and operating on matrices. The package is
      called "matrix" and the core class is "matrix". Perhaps I should
      use a less generic name. Let me know if the name causes
      problems.
    </p>

    <h3> Type-specific matrix functions </h3>
    
    <p>
      The general strategy has been to 1) make things work and then
      make them work quickly.  To this end, I have been writing
      functions for matrix operations in a general manner first and
      then recoding type-specific versions to make certain operations
      go faster.  This is done via liberal use of macros to generate
      type-specific functions and methods for matrix operations that
      go much faster than the general versions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The convention is that a generic function such as sum-range will
      have a generic version that works with all matrices and type
      specific versions thaqt work with specific matrices. g In order
      to support these functions there may be internal methods,
      prefixed with a %, that implement certain type-specific
      functionality.  Macros that generate the code used for the
      type-specific methods will be prefixed with a %%.  In theory,
      the %%-macros can be called from other code that need to
      generate in-place code where the overhead of the method-call to
      the %-method would be too expensive. This convention is not yet
      widely enforced and certainly untested. Hopefully this situation
      will improve.
